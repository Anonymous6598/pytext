Welcome to The Pytext Editor!
=============================

Looks like you opened pytext without a file argument...
it is recommended to add the pytext directory to your user PATH variable, so you can run it in terminal.
    Example:
    $ pytext (file)

Pytext is a study project and it is being developed by Lorenzo Pandolfo.
Some features are not ready yet and bugs are possible to happen.

If you presented bugs or have a cool idea to add to pytext, feel free to open a issue in
https://github.com/lorenzolpandolfo/pytext

For more information and help, check the github repository.
Best wishes!
